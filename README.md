# waste_Segregation_CNN

- Dataset
The dataset consists of images of some common waste material categories. The images are classified into seven categories, namely: Food Waste, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Other, Cardboard, and Glass. 
The data set contains seven folders, one containing images of each waste category.
Approximately 7,000 raw images are divided among the categories.
The data set consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as Cardboard, Food_Waste and Metal.
Each folder contains images of objects that belong to that category. However, these items are not further subcategorised.
For instance, the Food_Waste folder may contain images of items such as coffee grounds, tea bags and fruit peels without explicitly stating that they are coffee grounds or tea bags.
 
- Problem Statement
Now, letâ€™s understand the problem statement, business objective and data to be used for this assignment.

Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly. An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.
 
- Key business benefits include:

Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour
Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables

- Use Cases:

Smart Recycling Bins
Automated Waste Sorting Facilities
Waste Monitoring and Reporting
 
This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices. In this assignment, you will:

Train and fine-tune a CNN model to classify waste such as cardboard, glass, paper and plastic
Evaluate model accuracy using performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1-score
Gain insights into the role of AI in sustainable environmental solutions
